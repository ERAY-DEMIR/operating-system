In this project as a group, we used Simulink, which works inside MATLAB, to create circuits that park cars to available lots. Empty lots and available lots displayed with seven- segment display.  
Minimum requirement for implementing this project: Matlab R2023A
For implementations please click "step forward".
In this project there are 5 parking lots. These lots controlled by 3x5 decoder and xor gate.
If you wanna put car to the third lot, you need to set values to 0 1 1 respectively in decoder. Then click step forward. If there is car at third lot, you need to click step forward to phase out the car. After that, click step forward again.
